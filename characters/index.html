<h1>My characters</h1>
<hr />
<h3>Chris The Hybrid <span style="color: #008000;">Cat</span> - <span style="color: #ff0000;">Demon</span></h3>
<p>Chris is the character I've used since late 2018, my friend, <a title="Advance's Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/VancyNo">NeigePastel</a>, helped me get to his final design.</p>
<p>He is the main character in my Indie game Techno-Break.</p>
<p>Originally he was a self insert but now, even though he still has my name, he isn't meant to be a self insert.</p>
<p>Chris is (mostly) mute, and has fire powers. He's mostly up-beat and happy but can be shy sometimes.</p>

<h3>Ruby The <span style="color: #ff00d8;">Cat</span> - <span style="color: #00b4ff;">Mechanic</span></h3>
<p>Ruby is a character I made during when I was getting my game into Gamemaker (before i switched to godot)</p>
<p>She is the "sidekick" character in my Indie game Techno-Break.</p>
<p>Originally she was meant to be an asshole villain but then I acquired a brain and realized that was dumb.</p>
<p>Ruby is a mechanic that can build anything she puts her mind to. She's very nervous, very shy, and very gay.</p>
